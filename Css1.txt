Detailed Explanation about Box model, CSS Units, and Flex topics in CSS : -

Box Model in CSS : -

	The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes how elements on a 
	webpage are structured and sized. 

It consists of four main parts : -

1 ) Content : -
	 This is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media.

2 ) Padding : -
	 The padding is the space between the content and the element's border. 
	It can be set using properties like ` padding-top `, ` padding-right `, ` padding-bottom `,
	 and ` padding-left `.

3 ) Border : -
	 The border surrounds the padding and content.
	 It can be styled using properties like ` border-width `, ` border-style `, and ` border-color `.

4 ) Margin : -
	 The margin is the space outside the border.
	 It separates one element from another. 
	It can be set using properties like ` margin-top `, ` margin-right `, ` margin-bottom `,
	 and ` margin-left `.
In CSS, you can adjust these parts using various properties. 

css
	.box {
	  width: 200px;
	  padding: 20px;
	  border: 1px solid black;
	  margin: 10px;
	}

	Here, width sets the ` width ` of the content area,`  padding ` creates space
	 between the content and the border, ` border ` defines the border around the padding, 
	and ` margin ` sets the space outside the border.

CSS Units : -
	CSS provides various units to specify sizes. Here are some commonly used units:

1)  Absolute Units : -
	 These are fixed in relation to physical units or the viewport.

> ` px ` (pixels) : - A single dot on a screen.
> ` in ` (inches), ` cm ` (centimeters), ` mm ` (millimeters) : - Physical units, though their accuracy can vary on different devices.

2 ) Relative Units : -
	 These are relative to something else, such as the font size or the viewport dimensions.

> ` em ` : -  Relative to the font-size of the element.
> ` rem ` : -  Relative to the font-size of the root element (html).
> ` vw ` (viewport width), ` vh ` (viewport height) : -  Relative to the viewport dimensions.
> ` % ` : - Percentage relative to the parent element.

3 ) Flexible Units : -
	 These adjust based on the content or other factors.

> ` fr ` (fraction) : - Used in CSS Grid Layout to distribute available space.
> ` auto ` : -  Automatically adjusts based on context.
	
	Units are crucial for responsive design and accessibility, allowing developers to 
	create layouts that adapt well across different devices and screen sizes.

Flexbox in CSS : -

	Flexbox is a layout model in CSS designed to align and distribute space among items 
	in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. 
Key concepts include : -

Flex Container : -
	 The parent element that holds the flex items. 
	It's defined by applying ` display: flex; ` or ` display: inline-flex; ` to an element.

Flex Items :  -
	 The children of a flex container. 
	They automatically become flexible and can be aligned in different directions.

Main Axis and Cross Axis  : -
	 These are defined by the ` flex-direction ` property. 
	The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out ( ` row or column `). 
	The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

> ` justify-content ` : - Aligns flex items along the main axis.

> ` align-items ` : - Aligns flex items along the cross axis.

> ` flex-direction ` : - Establishes the main axis.

> ` flex-wrap ` : - Controls whether flex items are forced into a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines.

>  ` flex ` : - A shorthand for ` flex-grow `, `  flex-shrink `, and ` flex-basis `.

	Flexbox is widely used for creating flexible and responsive layouts, 
	making it easier to achieve complex alignments and spacing that were traditionally challenging 
	with older layout methods like floats and positioning.
