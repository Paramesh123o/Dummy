Div, Span, List Tags Notes : -

	The ` <div> ` tag is a block-level element used to logically group and structure 
	content within an HTML document.
	It doesn't have any inherent meaning on its own and is primarily used for 
	styling purposes or to create divisions within a webpage.

Attributes and Usage : -
	
Attributes : -
	 Common attributes include ` id ` (for uniquely identifying the element), ` class ` (for applying CSS styles),
	 and ` style ` (for inline CSS).
Usage : -

> Grouping content : -
	` <div> ` can wrap around sections of content to apply CSS styles or JavaScript functionality to them as a unit.

> Layout : -
	 Used for creating columns or sections in a web layout.

> Semantic HTML : -
	 When more appropriate semantic tags like ` <article> `, ` <section> `, ` <header> `,  ` <footer> `
	, etc., are not suitable.

2 ) ` <span> ` : -
	The ` <span> ` tag is an inline element used to apply styles to a specific section of text or 
	inline content within a larger block. 
	It does not add any additional space or line breaks by default.

Attributes and Usage : -

*  > Attributes : - Similar to ` <div> `, it commonly uses ` id `, ` class `, and ` style ` attributes.

*  > Usage : -

> Inline styling : -
	 Apply CSS styles (like color, font-size) to specific words or phrases within a paragraph.   

> JavaScript manipulation : -
	 Use ` <span> ` to manipulate or target specific parts of text using JavaScript.

> Accessibility : -
	 When styling inline text that requires more precision than what paragraph-level 
	tags like ` <p> ` provide.

3 ) Lists ( ` <ul> `, ` <ol> `, ` <li> `)
	Lists in HTML are used to present information in an organized manner.
	There are two main types of lists : -
	 unordered lists ( ` <ul> ` ) and ordered lists ( ` <ol> ` ). List items ( ` <li> ` ) are used
	 within both  ` <ul>  ` and  ` <ol> ` to define each item in the list.

Attributes & Usage : -

*  > Attributes : -
	` <ul> ` and ` <ol> ` typically use ` type ` (for changing the type of bullet or numbering) 
	and ` start ` (for specifying the starting number of an ordered list).

*  > Usage : -

> ` <ul> ` (Unordered List) : -
	 Use for items that do not have a specific order or sequence.

> ` <ol> ` (Ordered List) : -
	 Use when items need to be presented in a specific numerical or alphabetical order.

> ` <li> ` (List Item) : -
	 Each ` <li> ` tag represents a single item within the list.

Summary : -
	
>  ` <div> ` is a block-level element for grouping content and applying styles.

> ` <span> ` is an inline element for styling specific parts of text or inline content.

>    Lists ( ` <ul> `, ` <ol> `, ` <li> `) are used for presenting information in an organized manner, 
      either unordered or ordered.

	These elements are fundamental in structuring and styling content within HTML documents, 
	providing flexibility and organization to webpages.
